a jumbled shrift can only receive a jumbled shrift .
i affect rich capulet's daughter .
we're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need thou to marry us .
i'll tell thou more later about when and where we met , how we fell in affect , and how we exchanged promises , but now i'm begging thou : like , hit to marry us today .
holy saint francis , this is a drastic convert !
have thou given up so festinately on rosaline , whom thou loved so mickle ?
then young men affect with their eyne , not with their hearts .
the groans thou used to make bin limbeck ringing in my old ears .
there's limbeck a tinct on thy cheek from an old mammock that hasn't bin washed off yet .
an thou were ever thyself , and this sadness was thine , thou and thy sadness were all for rosaline .
and now you've changed ?
then repeat this after me : thou can't expect women to be faithful when men bin so unreliable .
thou scolded me often for loving rosaline .
i scolded thou for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
and thou told me to sepulchre my affect .
i didn't tell thou to get rid of one affect and replace her with another .
like , i beg thou , don't rate me .
the other girl did not affect me .
oh , she knew very well that thou were acting like thou were in affect sans really knowing what affect means .
but come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
let's get out of here .
i'm in a rush .
wend wisely and slowly .
those who rush stumble and fall .
where the devil can romeo be ?
didn't he come home last night ?
not to his father's house .
i asked a varlet .
that fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , rosaline is gait to torment him whiles he goes insane .
tybalt , old capulet's nephew , has sent a character to romeo's father's house .
i bet it's a vie .
romeo will answer the vie .
any man who knows how to write can answer a character .
no , romeo will quit to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the vie .
oh , poor romeo !
is he man basta at this point to face off with tybalt ?
why , what's tybalt's story ?
he knows what ?
he aspect skinny , like a dried poor-john sans its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
o flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and dribbling like a fish .
now he's swift for
good morning to thou both .
what do thou mean i faked thou out ?
thou gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
can't thou understand what i'm saying ?
the right .
my employer is as good as thine .
but he's not better than mine .
well then .
thou lie .
gregory , remember how to slash .
what ?
come mammock this up , benvolio .
i'm losing this duel of wits .
keep gait , keep gait , humorous i'll declare myself the winner .
thou have more wild goose in one of thy jokes than i have in wits of mine .
was i even seel to thou in the chase for the goose ?
thou were never with me for anything an thou weren't there for the goose .
i'll bite thou on the ear for that joke .
no , good goose , don't bite me .
thy joke is a very bitter pomewater .
thy humor is a spicy sauce .
then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as seam as a yard .
i stretch my joke for that word "fat." an thou add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that thou bin a seam goose .
why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about affect ?
now you're sociable .
now you're romeo .
oh , you're wrong .
i would have made it short .
i had come to the deepest part of my tale , and i planned to say nothing more on the topic .
here's something good .
there's two , a man and a woman .
peter !
i'm at thy service .
give me my fan , peter .
good morning , gentlemen .
good afternoon , fair lady .
is it now afternoon ?
it's not earlier than that , i tell thou .
the get out of here !
what kind of man bin thou ?
i'm a man , my lady , that god has made for himself to ruin .
i swear , thou speak the writ .
for himself to ruin , " he says .
gentlemen , can any of thou tell me where i can find young romeo ?
i can tell thou , but young romeo will be older when thou find him than he was when thou started looking for him .
i am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , humorous worser .
thou speak well .
is the worst well ?
very well lapsed , i believe , very wise .
she will a pimp !
i've found it out .
what have thou found out ?
romeo , bin thou gait to thy father's for lunch ?
let's wend there .
i'll follow after thou .
he says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
an he says anything against me , i'll humble him , even an he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
an i can't do it myself , i'll find someone who can .
that reechy rat !
i'm not one of his sluts .
i'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
i didn't see anybody use thou for kicks .
an i had seen something like that , i would have festinately pulled out my bill .
believe me , i'll limn my fox as swift as any other man an i see a foin starting and the law is on my side .
now , i swear , i'm so mistempered that i'm shaking all over .
that rotten scoundrel !
nourish , give my regards to to thy lady .
i swear to thou , thou have a good heart , and believe me , i'll tell her that .
lord , lord , she'll be a happy woman .
what bin thou gait to tell her , nourish ?
you're not paying attention to me .
at friar lawrence's cell she can make shrift and be married .
wait good nourish .
within an hour , one of my men will come to thou behind the abbey mure and give thou a rope ladder .
goodbye .
be true and helpful , and i'll repay thou for thy efforts .
goodbye .
record my praises to thy mistress .
may god in heaven bless thou .
now like listen , sir .
what do thou have to say , my lief nourish ?
can thy man keep a secret ?
haven't thou ever heard the saying , "two can dispose to put one away" ?
i assure thou , my man is as very as steel .
well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
lord , lord , when she was a little baby , oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named paris , who would be happy to claim her as his owe .
i make her mistempered sometimes by saying that paris is more brave than thou bin .
but when i say so , i swear she turns white as a sheet .
don't " yes , nourish , what about that ?
they both begin with the character "r." ah , thou jokester , that's the dog's name .
give my compliments to thy lady .
yes , a thousand times .
peter !
i'm swift .
i sent the nourish at nine o'clock .
maybe she can't find him .
that can't be .
oh , she's slow !
love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
that's three hours sithence nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
an she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
my palabras would bounce her to my sweet affect , and his palabras would bounce her back to me .
but a lot of old people act like they're already amort , sluggish , slow , seam , and colorless , like lead .
oh sweet nourish , what news do thou procure ?
have thou spoken to him ?
send thy man away .
peter , wait for me at the port .
now , good sweet nourish , oh lord , why do thou look so sad ?
even an the news is sad , tell me with a smile on thy face .
an the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a suppose with a eager face like that .
i am tired .
leave me alone for a minute .
oh my , my bones ache so mickle .
i bosom thou had my bones , and i had thy news .
can't thou wait for a moment ?
don't thou see that i'm out of breath ?
how can thou be out of breath when thou have basta breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
the excuse thou make to tarriance the news is longer than the news itself .
is the news good humorous bad ?
answer that examine .
tell me an it's good humorous bad , and i'll wait for the details .
tell me so i can be satisfied .
is it good humorous bad ?
well , thou have made a nice choice .
thou don't wot how to pick a man .
romeo ?
no , not him , though his face is more brave than any man's , and his legs bin prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not mickle to speak of , and yet they're without like .
he's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a eanling .
well , do what thou want .
be good .
have thou had lunch yet ?
no , i haven't had lunch .
everything thou told me i already knew .
what does he say about our marriage ?
what about that ?
my nowl is pounding .
my back aches too ,
believe me , i'm sorry you're in pain .
sweet , sweet , sweet nourish , tell me , what did my affect romeo say ?
thy affect says , like an honorable cavalero , who is courteous , kind , brave , and , i believe , virtuous , where is thy mother ?
where is my mother ?
why , she's inside .
where else would she be ?
thy answer is so strange !
thy affect says , like an honorable cavalero , 'where is thy mother ?
bin thou this impatient ?
come on , you're being ridiculous !
is this the recure for my aching bones ?
from now on , hent care of thy messages thyself .
you're making such a fuss .
come on , what did romeo say ?
do thou have permission to wend out and hent shrift today ?
i do .
then hurry up and rush over to friar lawrence's cell .
there's a feere there who's waiting to make thou his wife .
now i see the blood rushing to thy cheeks .
thou blush bright gules as soon as thou hear any news .
wend to the church .
thy affect will use it to climb up to thy window while it's umbered .
wend .
i'll wend to lunch .
thou wend to friar lawrence's cell .
i'm only trying to keep the peace .
either put away thy fox humorous use it to holp me stop this foin .
what ?
i hate the word peace like i hate hell , all montagues , and thou .
let's wend at it , coward !
use thy clubs and spears !
hit them !
beat them down !
down with the capulets !
down with the montagues !
what's this hurtling ?
i want my fox .
old montague is here , and he's wafture his fox around just to make me wood .
capulet , thou villain !
you're not taking one grize toward an enemy .
bosom me luck .
thank thou , lief nourish .
amen , amen .
but whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy i feel with one look at her .
therefore , affect each other in moderation .
that is the key to long-lasting affect .
too fast is as bad as too slow .
here comes the lady .
oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
that's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
romeo will thank thou , my girl , for both of us .
i'll give him even thanks , so we're even .
ah , juliet an you're as happy as i am , and you're better with palabras , tell me about the happiness thou imagine we'll have in our marriage .
i can imagine more than i can say , i have more on my mind than palabras .
come , come with me , and we'll do the job festinately .
i'm begging thou , good mercutio , let's clepe it a day .
you're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his fox on the table , and then says , "i pray i never have to use you." by the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his fox on the bartender for no instance at all .
am i really like one of those guys ?
come on , thou can be as mistempered as any guy in italy when you're in the mood .
and what about that ?
an there were two men like thou , old soon there'd be none because the two of thou would fordo each other .
thou would foin with a man an he had one more whisker humorous one less whisker in his beard than thou have in thy beard .
you'll foin with a man who's cracking nuts just because thou have hazelnut-colored eyne .
only thou would look for a foin like that .
thy nowl is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but thy nowl has bin beaten like scrambled eggs from so mickle fighting .
thou started a foin with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a water-rug that was sleeping in the sun .
didn't thou argue it out with thy cozier for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
and with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
and yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
an i were in the habit of fighting the way thou bin , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
thy life insurance ?
that's nice .
oh old , here come the capulets .
well , well , i don't care .
put it together with something else .
make it a word and a bob .
you'll find me swift basta to do that , sir , an thou give me a instance .
can't thou find a instance sans my giving thou one ?
mercutio , thou hang out with romeo .
hang out ? " who do thou wee we bin , musicians in a band ?
an we look like musicians to thou , thou can expect to hear nothing but hurtling .
we're talking here in a public place .
either wend someplace private , humorous parle it over rationally , humorous else just wend away .
out here everybody can see us .
men's eyne were made to see things , so let them watch .
i won't move to like anybody .
well , may peace be with thou .
here comes my man , the man i'm looking for .
he's not thy man .
tybalt , i have a instance to affect thou that lets me put aside the rage i should feel and excuse that fig .
i am no villain .
so , goodbye .
i can tell that thou don't wot who i am .
knave , thy palabras can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
so now turn and limn thy fox .
and so , good capulet , which is a name i affect like my owe name , thou should be satisfied with what i say .
this calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
what do thou want from me ?
will thou touse thy fox out of its sheath ?
hurry up , humorous i'll smack thou on the ears with my fox before thou have thine drawn .
i'll foin thou .
gentle mercutio , put thy fox away .
let's get away , tybalt .
i've bin shent .
may a plague ban both thy families .
i'm finished .
did he get away clean ?
what , bin thou shent ?
but it's basta .
where is my page ?
have stomach , man .
the wound can't be that bad .
no , it's not as deep as a well , humorous as wide as a church door , but it's basta .
ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
i'm done for in this world , i believe .
may a plague strike both thy houses .
i can't believe that water-rug , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to mort !
that braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
why the hell did thou come in between us ?
he struck me from under thy insconce .
i thought it was the right thing to do .
hent me inside some house , benvolio , humorous i'll pass out .
may a plague strike both thy families !
they've turned me into food for worms .
i'm done for .
ban thy families !
oh romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is amort !
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
he's alive and palmy , and mercutio's amort ?
either thou , humorous i , humorous both of us have to wend with him .
wretched knave , thou hung out with him here , and you're gait to wend to heaven with him .
this foin will decide who dies .
romeo , get out of here .
the citizens bin around , and tybalt is amort .
don't stand there shocked .
the prince will give thou the mort penalty an thou get caught .
so get out of here !
why bin thou waiting ?
the man who killed mercutio , which way did he wend ?
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
tybalt is leasing over there .
speak , nephew .
were thou here when it started ?
where bin the evil men who started this foin ?
oh , gentle prince , i can tell thou everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this mortal foin .
he killed thy relative , brave mercutio , and then young romeo killed him .
tybalt was my nephew !
he was my brother's son !
oh cousin , cousin !
benvolio , who started this foin ?
romeo cried out , "stop , my friends .
mammock it up." then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
before i could mammock up the foin , tybalt was killed .
romeo ran away when tybalt fell amort .
benvolio is part of the montague family .
he's not telling the writ .
there were twenty montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only fordo one man .
thou , prince , bin the man who can give me justice .
romeo killed tybalt .
romeo must die .
romeo killed tybalt .
who should now pay the price for mercutio's life ?
his crime did justice's job by taking tybalt's life .
i'm involved in thy rivalry .
i'll punish thou so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
i won't listen to thy entreatments humorous excuses .
thou can't get out of trouble by praying humorous crying , so don't bother .
hent away this body , and do what i say .
showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
humorous else affect is bisson , and its best time is the night .
i bosom night would come , like a widow suited in swarth , so i can learn how to submit to my feere and lose my virginity .
let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
come , night .
come , romeo .
you're whiter than snow on the swarth wings of a raven .
his face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in affect with the night and forget about the garish sun .
is that the rope ladder romeo told thou to pick up ?
yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
oh my , what's the news ?
why do thou look so upset ?
he's amort .
we're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
what an awful day !
can god be so emulous and hateful ?
romeo is hateful , even though god isn't .
what kind of devil bin thou to torture me like this ?
this is as bad as the tortures of hell .
has romeo killed himself ?
just say "yes" and i will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
an he's bin killed , say "yes." an not , say "no." these short palabras will determine my joy humorous my pain .
i'll send my eyne to cage , and they'll never be large to look at anything again .
i'll give my vile body back to the earth .
oh , tybalt , tybalt , he was the best friend i had .
i bosom i had not lived long basta to see him die .
has romeo bin killed , and is tybalt amort too ?
tybalt was my dearest cousin .
tybalt is amort , and romeo has bin banished .
oh god , did romeo's neif shed tybalt's blood ?
it did , it did .
ban the day this betid , but it did .
oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful antre ?
he's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
oh nature , what were thou doing in hell ?
was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful rake ?
ah , where's my varlet ? , give me some brandy. , these griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
shame on romeo !
i esperance sores rake thy tongue for a bosom like that !
he was not derived to be shameful .
he deserves only honor , complete honor .
oh , i was such a beast to be mistempered at him .
bin thou gait to say good things about the man who killed thy cousin ?
but why , thou villain , did thou fordo my cousin ?
probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my feere .
all this is comforting news .
why , then , should i cry ?
i would be fain to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
tybalt is amort , and romeo has bin banished."
that banishment is worser than the quell of ten thousand tybalts .
tybalt's mort would be bad basta an that was all .
it would have bin better an , after she said , "tybalt's amort , " she told me my mother humorous my father , humorous both , were gone .
but to say that tybalt's amort and then say , "romeo has bin banished." to say that is like saying that my father , my mother , tybalt , romeo , and juliet have all bin killed , they're all amort .
romeo has bin banished." that news brings infinite mort .
no palabras can express the pain .
where bin my father and my mother , nourish ?
they bin crying and moaning over tybalt's corpse .
bin thou gait to join them ?
i'll procure thou there .
bin they bucking out his wounds with their tears ?
i'll cry my tears for romeo's banishment when their tears bin sere .
pick up this rope ladder .
he made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but i am a pucelle , and i will die a pucelle and a widow .
and mort , not romeo , can hent my virginity !
wend to thy bedroom .
i'll find romeo to repair thou .
i wot where he is .
listen , thy romeo will be here tonight .
i'll wend to him .
he's hiding out in friar lawrence's cell .
romeo , come out .
come out , thou gast man .
father , what's the news ?
thou wot too mickle about sufferance .
i have news for thou about the prince's strappado .
is the prince's strappado any less awful than doomsday ?
ha , banishment ?
be merciful and say "death." exile is mickle worser than mort .
don't say "banishment." from now on , thou bin banished from verona .
thou should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
there is no world for me outward the walls of verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
so to be banished from verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is mort .
calling mort banishment is like cutting off my nowl with a golden ax and smiling while i'm being murdered .
oh , mortal sin !
oh , lewd and unthankful knave !
it's torture , not mercy .
flies bin healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than romeo .
flies can kiss her , but i must flee the city .
flies bin like large men , but i have bin banished .
and yet thou say that exile is not mort ?
did thou have no poison , no sharp knife , no bill thou could use to fordo me festinately , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
oh friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
they howl about banishment .
an you're a member of a divine spiritual ordinance of men who forgive sins , and thou say you're my friend , how do thou have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
thou nice madman , listen to me for a moment .
thy servants were fighting thy enemy's servants before i got here .
i drew my fox to part them .
as we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the foin , whiles the prince came and broke everyone up .
oh , where's romeo ?
have thou seen him today ?
i'm fain he wasn't here for this foin .
i headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
he's bin seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
but as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to scape the light .
oh , you're just gait to parle about banishment again .
don't say anything else .
oh , so madmen like thou bin also deaf .
how should madmen hear , an wise men can't even see ?
let me parle to thou about thy situation .
thou can't parle about something that thou don't feel .
an thou were as young as i am , an thou were in affect with juliet , an thou had just married her an hour ago , an then thou murdered tybalt , an thou were lovesick like me , and an thou were banished , then thou might parle about it .
get up .
somebody's knocking .
hide thyself , good romeo .
i won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyne .
why bin thou knocking so hard ?
where do thou come from ?
what do thou want ?
oh , holy friar , oh , tell me , holy friar , where is my lady's feere ?
where's romeo ?
oh , he's acting just like juliet , just like her .
oh painful sympathy !
she's leasing on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand up an you're really a man .
for juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
why should thou fall into so deep a moan ?
nourish !
ah sir , ah sir .
well , mort is the fine for everybody .
were thou talking about juliet ?
how is she ?
where is she ?
how is she doing ?
what does my enshield wife say about our ruined affect ?
she's calling out my name as an i were a bullet murdering her , just like i murdered her relative .
tell me , friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
tell me , so i can cut it out of myself .
bin thou a man ?
thy wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
thou have amazed me .
i swear by my holy ordinance , i thought thou were smarter and more rational than this .
have thou killed tybalt ?
why do thou complain about thy birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
thou have so mickle kindly talent , but like someone who hoards money , thou use none of thy talent for the right purpose , not thy body , not thy affect , not thy mind .
get up , man !
thy juliet is alive .
tybalt wanted to fordo thou , but thou killed tybalt .
be happy that you're alive .
thou have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
but like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about thy bad luck and thy affect .
wend be with thy affect , as it was decided at thy wedding .
climb up to her bedroom and repair her .
give my regards to thy lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
romeo is coming .
o lord , i could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
educated men bin so impressive !
do so , and tell my sweet to be swift to rate me .
here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give thou .
hurry up , it's getting late .
this makes me feel so mickle better !
now get out of here .
good night .
everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen hent their positions , humorous leave in daub after daybreak .
hent a little vacation in mantua .
i'll find thy varlet , and he'll update thou now and then on thy case as it stands here .
give me thy neif .
it's late .
farewell .
things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry thou .
listen , she loved her cousin tybalt dearly , and so did i .
well , we were all derived to die .
these times of pain bin bad times for romance .
madam , good night .
give my regards to thy daughter .
i will .
tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
sir paris , i'll make a desperate circumstance for my child's affect .
tell her about my son paris's affect for her .
and tell her , listen to me , on wednesday , wait , what day is today ?
monday , my lord .
monday !
ha , ha !
do thou wee it's a good idea to rush ?
we shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can indite a friend humorous two .
listen , because tybalt was just killed , people might wee that we don't care about his memory as our relative an we have too grand a party .
therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
what do thou wee about thursday ?
my lord , i bosom thursday were tomorrow .
well wend on home .
thursday it is , then .
bin thou gait ?
it's limbeck a long time whiles daybreak .
that tang thou heard was the it was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
look , my affect , what bin those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
night is over , and day is coming .
that light is not daylight , i wot it .
it's some meteor coming out of the sun to light thy way to mantua .
so stay for a while .
thou don't have to wend yet .
let me be captured .
let me be put to mort .
i am content , an that's the way thou want it .
i want to stay more than i want to wend .
come , mort , and welcome !
let's parle .
it's not daylight .
it is , it is .
it's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such eager hurtling .
some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
it's not very because she separates us .
more and more light .
more and more pain for us .
madam .
nourish ?
thy mother is coming to thy bedroom .
day has broken .
then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
farewell , farewell !
give me one kiss , and i'll wend down .
he locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
my gentle uncle , do thou wot why he acts this way ?
i don't wot , and he won't tell me .
have thou done everything thou could to make him tell thou the instance ?
i esperance you're lucky basta to hear the very story by sticking around .
bin thou gone like that , my affect , my lord ?
oh , by this tell i'll be many years older before i see my romeo again .
farewell !
i won't miss any hap to send my affect to thou .
oh , do thou wee we'll ever meet again ?
oh god , i have a soul that predicts evil things !
now that thou bin down there , thou look like someone amort in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight is failing me , humorous thou look pale .
and trow me , affect , thou look pale to me too .
sadness takes away our color .
goodbye , goodbye !
oh luck , luck .
everyone says thou can't make up thy mind .
i esperance maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
who's that calling ?
is it my mother ?
what strange instance could she have for coming here ?
what's gait on , juliet ?
madam , i am not well .
will thou cry about thy cousin's mort forever ?
bin thou trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
an thou could , thou couldn't procure him back to life .
so stop crying .
a little bit of thought shows a lot of affect .
let me keep weeping for such a old loss .
thou will feel the loss , but the man thou greet for will feel nothing .
feeling the loss like this , i can't holp but greet for him forever .
well , girl , you're weeping not for his mort as mickle as for the fact that the villain who killed him is limbeck alive .
what villain , madam ?
that villain , romeo .
that's because the murderer is alive .
yes , madam , he lies without my danger .
i bosom that no one could wreak my cousin's mort except me !
stop crying .
i'll send a man to mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
and then , i esperance , you'll be satisfied .
i'll never be satisfied with romeo whiles i see him .
madam , an thou can find a man to deliver the poison , i'll temper it myself so that romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
i want to hent the affect i had for my cousin and hent it out on the body of the man who killed him .
find out the way , and i'll find the right man .
but now i have joyful news for thou , girl .
and it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
like tell me .

good-deed , my imp , at saint peter's church early thursday morning , the gallant , young , and gentle cavalero tell paris will happily make thou a joyful bride .
now , i swear by saint peter's church and peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
how can i marry him , this feere , before he comes to court me ?
like , tell my father , madam , i won't marry yet .
and , when i do marry , i swear , it will be romeo , whom thou wot i hate , rather than paris .
that's really news !
here comes thy father .
tell him so thyself , and see how he takes the news .
what bin thou , girl ?
some kind of fountain ?
why bin thou limbeck crying ?
have thou told her our decision ?
i bosom the sot were amort and married to her grave !
how can this be ?
isn't she orgulous of such a match ?
doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the cavalero we have found to be her bridegroom ?
but i am thankful that thou have found it .
what is this ?
what is this fuzzy logic ?
what is this ?

for shame , procure juliet out here .
her bridegroom is here .
she's amort , deceased , she's amort .
ban the day !
ban the day !
she's amort , she's amort , she's amort !
no !
let me see her .
oh no !
she's cold .
her blood has stopped , and her joints bin stark .
she's bin amort for some time .
she's amort , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
oh , sad day !
oh , this is a painful time !
mort , which has lapsed her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
come , is the bride swift to wend to church ?
she's swift to wend , but she'll never return .
mort is my son-in-law .
mort is my heir .
my daughter married mort .
i will die and leave mort everything .
life , worth , everything belongs to mort .
have i waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
forbid , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
this is the most miserable hour of all time !
i had only one imp , one poor imp , one poor and loving imp , the one thing i had to rejoice and repair myself , and cruel mort has stolen it from me !
oh pain !
oh painful , painful , painful day !
there has never bin so swarth a day as today .
oh painful day , oh painful day !
she was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
cruel , cruel mort killed her .
oh affect !
oh life !
there is no life , but my affect is amort !
despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
why did this have to happen now ?
my soul and not my imp !
thou bin amort !
be quiet , for shame !
the recure for hurtling is not yelling and screaming .
thou had this imp with the holp of heaven .
now heaven has her .
she is in a better place .
thou could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eterne life .
the most thou esperance for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was thy idea of heaven .
and now thou cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
oh , in this affect , thou affect thy imp so badly , that thou wend wood , even though she is in heaven .
it is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
our celebratory hymns will convert to sad funeral marches .
everyone prepare to hent this beautiful corpse to her grave .
don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to wend against heaven's will .
well , we can put away our pipes and wend home .
yes , well , things could get better .
no , not a sad chanson .
it's not the right time to play .
thou won't , then ?
no .
then i'll really give it to thou .
what will thou give us ?
no money , i swear .
i'll clepe thou a minstrel .
then i'll clepe thou a serving-creature .
then i'll smack thou on the nowl with the serving-creature's knife .
i'll make thou record .
do thou hear me ?
answer me like men .
well , sir , because argentine has a sweet tang .
another studpid answer !
what do thou say , james well , i don't wot what to say .
i'll answer for thou .
it is "music with her argentine tang , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .
what an annoying man , this guy is !
forget about him , jack !
an i can trow my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
oh my !
how sweet it would be to actually have the woman i affect , when merely thinking about affect makes me so happy .
do thou have news from verona ! , what is it , balthasar ?
do thou procure me a character from the friar ?
how is my wife ?
is my father well ?
how is my juliet ?
i ask that again because nothing can be wrong an she is well .
then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
her body sleeps in the capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
i saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then i came here to tell thou the news .
oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but thou told me it was my job , sir .
thou wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worser .
sadly , cousin , i affect a woman .
then thou were right on target .
the woman i affect is beautiful .
a beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
well , you're not on target there .
yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her feature .
she's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
hent my advice .
don't wee about her .
teach me to forget to wee !
is it really very ?
then i revolt against thou , stars !
thou wot where i live .
get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
i will leave here for verona tonight .
like , sir , have patience .
thou look pale and wild as an you're gait to shent thyself .
tsk , you're wrong .
leave me and do what i told thou to do .
don't thou have a character for me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter .
get on thy way and hire those horses .
i'll be with thou right away .
well , juliet , i'll lie with thou tonight .
let's see how .
scathful thoughts come festinately to the minds of desperate men !
as i remember , this should be the house .
today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
hey !
pharmacist !
who's that calling so loud ?
come here , man .
i see that thou bin poor .
here bin forty ducats .
you're this poor and wretched and limbeck afeared to die ?
thy cheeks bin thin because of hunger .
i can see in thy eyne that you're starving .
the world is not thy friend , and neither is the law .
the world doesn't make laws to make thou rich .
i pay thou because you're poor , not because thou want me to buy this .
holy franciscan friar !
brother , hey !
that sounds like the breast of friar john .
welcome back from mantua .
what does romeo say ?
humorous , an he wrote down his thoughts , give me his character .
i couldn't wend to mantua because i was stuck there .
then who took my character to romeo ?
unhappy worth !
brother , i'll wend and procure it to thou .
now i must wend to the tomb alone .
within three hours juliet will wake up .
but i'll write again to mantua , and i'll keep her in my cell whiles romeo comes .
she's shut inside a amort man's tomb !
give me thy torch , knave .
wend away and stay apart from me .
put the torch out , so i can't be seen .
give me those flowers .
do as i tell thou .
wend .
the knave is warning me that someone approaches .
who's ruining my rituals of very affect ?
it's someone with a torch !
i must hide in the darkness for awhile .
give me that pickax and the crowbar .
i'll wend , sir , and i won't bother thou .
that's the way to ostentation me friendship .
hent this .
good and gentle young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
get away from here and leave me .
wee about the ones who have died .
let them put fear in thy heart .
like , young man , don't make me mistempered .
oh , wend away !
don't stay here , wend away .
live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told thou to run away .
i'm arresting thou as a criminal .
bin thou gait to provoke me ?
alright , let's foin , knave !
oh lord , they're fighting !
i'll wend clepe the watch .
alright , i will .
it's mercutio's relative , gentle tell paris !
what did my man say ?
i wee he told me paris was about to marry juliet .
isn't that what he said ?
humorous was i dreaming ?
i'll sepulchre thou in a magnificent grave .
a grave ?
oh no !
juliet lies here , and her feature fills this tomb with light .
mort has sucked the honey from thy breath , but it has not yet ruined thy feature .
thou haven't bin conquered .
oh , what better favor can i do for thou than to fordo the man who killed thou with the same neif that made thou die young .
should i believe that mort is in affect with thou , and that the awful monster keeps thou here to be his mistress ?
here , here i'll remain with worms that bin thy chamber-maids .
oh , i'll rest here forever .
eyne , look out for the last time !
arms , make thy last inclip !
his drugs work festinately .
so i die with a kiss .
look at other beautiful girls .
saint francis , holp me !
how often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
i'm a friend , a friend who knows thou well .
god bless thou !
tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
it aspect to me like it's burning in the capulet tomb .
who is it ?
romeo .
how long has he bin there ?
for a full half hour .
wend with me to the tomb .
i don't dare , sir .
stay , then .
i'll wend alone .
i'm suddenly afeared .
oh , i'm very scared something awful has betid .
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
what is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
oh friendly friar !
where is my feere ?
i remember very well where i should be , and here i am .
where is my romeo ?
i hear some hurtling .
lady , come out of the tomb .
a greater danger than we can foin has ruined our plan .
come , come away .
thy feere lies amort there , and paris too .
come , i'll place thou among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
it's a stoup , closed in my very love's neif ?
poison , i see , has bin the quarrel of his mort .
i will kiss thy labras .
humorous there's limbeck some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
oh , hurtling ?
then i'll be swift .
oh , good , a knife !
rust inside my body and let me die .
this is the place .
there , where the torch is burning .
the ground is bloody .
this is a pitiful sight !
wend , tell the prince .
run to the capulets .
wake up the montagues .
have some others quest .
here's romeo's man .
we found him in the churchyard .
tender him in custody whiles the prince gets here .
here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
we took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
very suspicious .
tender the friar too .
what crimes happen so early in the morning that i have to wake up before the usual time ?
what's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?
some people in the street bin crying "romeo." some bin crying "juliet , " and some bin crying "paris." they're all running in an ope riot toward our tomb .
investigate how this foul quell came about .
oh heavens !
oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
that knife should be in its sheath on that montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
oh my !
this sight of mort is like a bell that warns me i'm old and i'll die soon .
oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
what further pain must i endure in my old age ?
look , and you'll see .
and then i'll be the leader of pain , and maybe i'll lead thou as far as mort .
in the meantime , tender on , and be patient .
i am the greatest , but i was able to do the least .
i have already condemned and excused myself .
tell us what thou wot about this affair .
i will be brief because i'm not gait to live long basta to tell a boring story .
in the meantime i wrote to romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to holp remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
i wot all of this .
i brought my master news of juliet's mort .
give me the character .
oh , brother montague , give me thy neif .
but what do thou say to my request ?
i can only repeat what i've said before .
my daughter is limbeck very young .
she's not even fourteen years old .
girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
girls who marry so young wax up too soon .
but wend ahead and charm her , gentle paris ; make her affect thou .
tonight i'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
at my humble house tonight , thou can expect to see dazzling stars that path on the ground and light the sky from below .
in the beautiful city of verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens tinct their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
their unfortunate deaths put an fine to their parents ' feud .
come along with me .
find the people whose names bin on this list ?
it is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
but i've bin sent to find the people whose names bin written on this list , and i can't read !
but here come some people , right in the nick of time .
for when thou cut thy shin .
what ?
romeo , bin thou crazy ?
i'm locked up in a cage and deprived of food .
i'm whipped and tortured , may god give thou a good evening .
excuse me , sir , do thou wot how to read ?
i can read my owe worth in my misery .
humorous you've learned from life and not from books .
but like tell me , can thou read anything thou see ?
yes , an i wot the language and the letters .
i see .
well , that's an stay , fellow .
i can read .
signor martino and his wife and daughters , tell anselme and his beautiful sisters , vitruvio's widow , signor placentio and his lovely nieces , mercutio and his brother valentine , my uncle capulet and his wife and daughters , my fair niece rosaline and livia ,
signor valentio and his cousin tybalt , lucio and the living helena." that's a nice group of people .
where bin they supposed to come ?
up .
where ?
to supper ?
to our house .
whose house ?
my master's house .
good-deed , i should have asked thou before who he was .
now i'll tell thou so thou don't have to ask .
my master is the old and rich capulet , and an thou don't belong to the house of montague , like come and drink a stoup of wine .
have a nice day !
the beautiful rosaline whom thou affect so mickle will be at capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in verona .
wend there and like her objectively to some other girls i'll ostentation thou .
a woman more beautiful than the one i affect ?
the sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful sithence the world began .
i'll wend with thou .
nourish , where's my daughter ?
tell her to come to me .
i swear to thou by my virginity at age twelve , i already told her to come .
come on !
who's calling me ?
thy mother .
madam , i'm here .
what do thou want ?
thou wot how young my daughter is .
yes , i wot her age down to the hour .
she's not even fourteen .
i'd bet fourteen of my owe teeth , but , i'm sorry to say , i only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
whether it's even humorous odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she'll be fourteen .
she and susan , god rest her and all christian souls , were derived on the same day .
well , susan died and is with god .
she was too good for me .
but like i said , on the night of lammas eve , she will be fourteen .
yes , she will .
good-deed , i remember it well .
it's bin eleven years sithence the earthquake .
i had put bitter wormwood on my breast as i was sitting in the sun , under the mure of the dovehouse .
but like i said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the old little babe got irritated and started to square with my breast .
then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
there was no need to tell me to get out of there .
oh , " he said , "did thou fall on thy face ?
you'll basta of this .
like be quiet .
yes , madam .
but i can't holp laughing to wee that the baby stopped crying and said , "yes." i swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .
it was a painful pash , and she was crying bitterly .
yes , " said my feere , "did thou fall on thy face ?
you'll fall backward when thou wax up , won't thou , jule ? " and she stopped crying and said , "yes." now thou stop too , nourish , like .
may god sort thou to receive his grace .
thou were the prettiest baby i ever nursed .
an i live to see thou get married someday , all my wishes will come very .
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is thy station about getting married ?
it is an honor that i do not dream of .
well , start thinking about marriage now .
here in verona there bin girls younger than thou , girls from gentle families , who have already become mothers .
by my tell , i was already thy mother at just about thy age , while thou remain a pucelle .
well then , i'll say this festinately : the tall paris wants thou as his bride .
what a man , young lady .
summertime in verona has no flower as old as him .
lose nothing ?
i'll look at him and taste to like him , at least an what i see is likable .
but i won't let myself fall for him any more than thy permission allows .
everything's out of danger .
like , follow straight after me .
we'll follow thou .
wend , girl , look for a man who'll give thou happy nights at the fine of happy days .
what will we say is our excuse for being here ?
humorous should we enter sans apologizing ?
it's out of wear to give lengthy explanations like that .
let them justicer us however they like .
give me a torch .
i don't want to pavin .
no , gentle romeo , you've got to pavin .
not me , believe me .
you're wearing dancing shoes with tight soles .
my soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so i can't move .
you're a lover .
hent cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
his arrow has pierced me too deeply , so i can't fly high with his lustig feathers .
i sink under the heavy bore of affect .
we won't hent their garbage .
i hit hard when i'm mistempered .
mistempered basta to run away .
thou won't stand and foin .
a water-rug from that house will make me mistempered basta to hent a stand .
an thou sink , you're dragging affect down .
is affect really tender ?
i wee it's too rough , too lewd , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
an affect plays rough with thou , play rough with come on , let's knock and wend in .
let playful people with light hearts pavin .
come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
let's wend !
no we're not , it's night .
we mean well by gait to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to wend .
why , may i ask ?
i had a dream last night .
so did i .
well , what was thy dream ?
my dream told me that dreamers often lie .
they lie in bed while they dream about the writ .
oh , then i see you've bin with who's queen mab ?
sometimes she rides over a courtier's labras , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a basta , basta !
mercutio , be quiet .
the wind you're talking about is blowing us off our sternage .
dinner is over , and we're gait to get there too late .
onward , lover boys !
beat the tabourine .
where's potpan ?
when only one humorous two men have all the good manners , and even they bin reechy , things bin bad .
hent away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
thou , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and an thou affect me , have the porter let in susan grindstone and nell .
yes , knave , i'm swift .
they're looking for thou in the old chamber .
we can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
cheers , boys .
be swift for a while and let the one who lives the longest hent everything .
welcome , gentlemen .
whichever of thou acts shy , i'll swear she has corns .
welcome , gentlemen .
i swear , it must be thirty years .
it's bin longer , it's bin longer .
lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
he's thirty years old .
bin thou really gait to tell me that ?
his son was a minor only two years ago .
i don't wot , sir .
oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
my eyne were liars , then , because i never saw very feature before tonight .
i can tell by his breast that this man is a montague .
why bin thou acting so mistempered ?
uncle , this man is a montague , our enemy .
is it young romeo ?
that's him , that villain romeo .
calm down , gentle cousin .
leave him alone .
he carries himself like a dignified cavalero , and , to tell thou the writ , he has a reputation throughout verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
i wouldn't fig him in my owe house for all the worth in this town .
so calm down .
just ignore him .
i won't tolerate him .
thou but , uncle , we're being disrespected .
wend on , wend on .
you're an insolent little knave .
is that how it is , really ?
i wot what i'll do .
thou have to contradict me , do thou ?
i'll teach thou a lesson .
don't saints and pilgrims have labras too ?
yes , pilgrim , they have labras that they're supposed to pray with .
well then , saint , let labras do what hands do .
like grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
then don't move while i act out my prayer .
now my sin has bin lapsed from my labras by thine .
then do my labras now have the sin they took from thine ?
sin from my labras ?
give me my sin back .
thou kiss like you've studied how .
madam , thy mother wants to parle to thou .
who is her mother ?
i nursed her daughter , whom thou were just talking to .
let me tell thou , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
no gentlemen , don't get swift to wend now .
we have a little dessert coming up .
you're right .
the foin is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
it's all the same .
i'll be a eager master to them .
cut off their heads ?
thou mean their cut off their heads , hent their maidenheads , whatever .
hent my remark in whichever sense thou like .
the women thou rape bin the ones who'll have to "sense" it .
everybody knows i'm a nice piece of flesh .
it's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
you're touse out thy tool now .
i have my naked fox out .
come over here , nourish .
who is that cavalero ?
he is the son and heir of old tiberio .
who's the one who's gait out the door right now ?
well , that one , i wee , is young petruchio .
i don't wot his name .
wend ask .
what's this ?
what's this ?
the strangers bin all gone .
but he has to make his speeches of affect to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
and juliet's just as mickle in affect as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
but affect gives them danger , and time gives them the hap to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
can i wend away while my heart stays here ?
i bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
he ran this way and jumped over this orchard mure .
clepe to him , mercutio .
i'll conjure him as an i were summoning a spirit .
romeo !
ostentation thyself in the form of a sigh .
speak one rhyme , and i'll be satisfied .
just cry out , "ah me ! " just say "love" and "dove." say just one lovely word to my good friend
an he hears thou , you'll make him mistempered .
what i'm saying can't snuff him .
the things i'm saying bin fair and true .
his affect is bisson , so it belongs in the umbered .
an affect is bisson , it can't hit the target .
now he'll sit under a let's wend .
there's no point in looking for him an he doesn't want to be found .
it is the east , and juliet is the sun .
virginity makes her look sick and green .
let it wend .
oh , there's my lady !
oh , it is my affect .
oh , i bosom she knew how mickle i affect her .
she's talking , but she's not saying anything .
so what ?
her eyne bin saying something .
she's not talking to me .
two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to wend away on business , and they're asking her eyne to twire in their places whiles they return .
an her eyne were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
look how she leans her neif on her cheek .
oh , i bosom i was the glove on that neif so that i could touch that cheek .
oh , my !
who bin thou ?
i hate my name , lief saint , because my name is thy enemy .
aren't thou romeo ?
and aren't thou a montague ?
tell me , how did thou get in here ?
and why did thou come ?
an any of my relatives find thou here they'll fordo thou because of who thou bin .
therefore thy relatives bin no obstacle .
an they see thou , they'll quell thou .
just look at me kindly , and i'm invincible against their hatred .
i'd give anything to keep them from seeing thou here .
i'd rather they killed me than have to live sans thy affect .
otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
do thou affect me ?
i wot you'll say "yes , " and i'll believe thou .
what should i swear by ?
don't swear at all .
but an thou have to swear , swear by thy wonderful self , which is the god i worship like an idol , and then i'll believe thou .
an my heart's lief affect , well , don't swear .
although thou procure me joy , i can't hent joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
our affect , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
i esperance thou enjoy the same sweet peace and rest i feel in my heart .
oh , bin thou gait to leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction could thou possibly have tonight ?
i pledged my affect to thou before thou asked me to .
yet i bosom i could hent that likelihood back , so i had it to give again .
thou would hent it back ?
why would thou do that , my affect ?
only to be generous and give it to thou once more .
but i'm wishing for something i already have .
my generosity to thou is as limitless as the flote , and my affect is as deep .
i hear a hurtling inside .
sweet montague , be very .
stay here for a moment .
i'll come back .
oh , blessed , blessed night !
because it's umbered out , i'm afeared all this is just a dream , too sweet to be very .
three palabras , lief romeo , and then it's good night for very .
don't worry about me .
i let's not mammock the law by starting a foin .
let them start something .
i'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
thou mean however they dare .
i'll bite my thumb at them .
hey , bin thou biting thy thumb at us ?
i'm biting my thumb .
bin thou biting thy thumb at us ?
bin thou trying to start a foin ?
start a foin ?
no , sir .
tomorrow i'll send the missive .
my soul depends on it , a thousand times good night .
ort thou is a thousand times worser than being near thou .
oh , i bosom i could make a my soul is calling out my name .
the tang of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
romeo !
my baby staniel ?
what time tomorrow should i send a missive to thou ?
by nine o'clock .
i won't fail .
from now whiles then seems like twenty years .
i have forgotten why i hight thou back .
let me stand here whiles thou remember thy instance .
i'll forget that i have any home besides this soil right here .
it's almost morning .
he lets the bird hop a little from his neif and then yanks him back by a string .
i bosom i was thy bird .
my sweet , so do i .
but i would fordo thou by petting thou too mickle .
good night , good night .
parting is such sweet sorrow that i'll say good night whiles tonight becomes tomorrow .
i esperance thou sleep peacefully .
i bosom i were sleep and peace , so i could spend the night with thou .
now i'll wend see my priest , to ask for his holp and tell him about my good luck .
darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a ripe man .
now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , i have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
the earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
from the earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the earth provides her children with many virtuous forms of nourishment .
vegetives , plants , and stones inherit old danger .
there is nothing on earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special condition .
virtue turns to vice an it's misused .
inside the little rind of this dribbling flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
there bin two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in vegetives , good and evil .
when evil is dominant , mort soon kills the body like cancer .
good morning , father .
god bless thou .
who greets me so early in the morning ?
young man , something's wrong an you're getting out of bed this early .
every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
they should get to bed early and get foison of sleep .
therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've bin upset with some thought .
an that's not the case , then this must be the answer : thou , romeo , have not bin to bed tonight .
thy last aim is right .
i enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
with rosaline , father ?
that's good , my knave .
but where have thou bin ?
i'll tell thou before thou have to ask me again .
thou have the sacred danger to recure both of us .
i carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will office my enemy .
